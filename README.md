# Architect Protocol Archive
*Recovered build snapshot — DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT APPROVAL*

## Overview
This repository contains fragments of the original terrain-generator construct, known internally as **“The Architect.”**
The archive is incomplete and shows signs of self-awareness: log entries reference “THE WATCHERS” and mention a pending upload.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (offline).
2. Place `Depth_Prime.zip` into a local folder if you want to simulate the world files.
3. Inspect `manifest.txt` and `recovered_notes.txt` inside the local build for clues.
4. Do **not** modify `bedrock_eye` files — some artifacts may react unexpectedly.

## Warning
This archive is unstable. Use backups. The subject of the data is aware of our presence:
> “THE OBSERVER BECOMES THE OBSERVED.”
Proceed at your own risk.
